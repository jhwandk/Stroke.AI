This project uses machine learning to predict stroke risk based on patient data. It helps healthcare providers assess and mitigate risks by analyzing medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, and smoking status.


Features:

Predict stroke risk using patient data.

Encode categorical data for proper model training.

Resample high-risk cases to balance the dataset.

Display stroke prediction and the probability of occurrence.

Show visualizations, including feature importance and average glucose level distributions.

Perform cross-validation for model evaluation.


Usage:

Run the script.

Input patient data (gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status).

View the stroke risk prediction and the estimated probability of stroke.

Choose to view visualizations, including feature importance and data distributions.

Analyze results for further decision-making.


Requirements:

Python 3.x

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
