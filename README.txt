Stroke Risk Prediction

Overview
This project predicts an individual's risk of having a stroke based on health factors like age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, BMI, and smoking status. It uses a logistic regression model and includes visualizations to show the importance of each factor and how glucose levels vary between high and low-risk individuals.

Features
- Predicts stroke risk using health data.
- Includes visualizations:
  - Shows which factors contribute the most to stroke risk.
  - Compares glucose levels in people with high and low stroke risk.
  - Displays the ratio of high-risk to low-risk individuals.
